Description: # Garden Escape
        
        Garden Escape was my final beginner project for Code in Place 2020. 
        It is a Gardening simulation game using tKinter for the GUI. 
        ## How to Play
        Use the mouse to move the gardener character. 
        Press spacebar or doubleclick to plant flowers or shrubs at the current location of the gardener.
        
        ## Libraries
        This game uses tkinter to render a GUI window so you can play the game.
        PIL is also used to help with image handling.
